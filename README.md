Repository for the Arduino Midi Switcher

I understand the struggle. Having to decide whether or not to shell out $400 for a midi switcher or pay off the months bills. I spent weeks trawling the internet for a how-to on building your own midi switcher. This is not to say that there wasn't anything out there, its just that there wasn't anything that was clear, concise and easy to follow. So I decided in the middle of July to make one myself. 

So here it is. My magnum opum. I present to the guitar/bass/keys/music community the OPEN SOURCE Arduino Midi Switcher. It is my hope that by releasing the code that more talented people will add features that I could never add and take it further then I ever could.

Repository for the Arduino Midi Switcher

I understand the struggle. Having to decide whether or not to shell out $400 for a midi switcher or pay off the months bills. I spent weeks trawling the internet for a how-to on building your own midi switcher. This is not to say that there wasn't anything out there, its just that there wasn't anything that was clear, concise and easy to follow. So I decided in the middle of July to make one myself. 

So here it is. My magnum opum. I present to the guitar/bass/keys/music community the OPEN SOURCE Arduino Midi Switcher. It is my hope that by releasing the code that more talented people will add features that I could never add and take it further then I ever could. 

Updates

Version 1.0 VANILLA SOURCE CODE
- 4 Banks, 7 Presets per bank
- Sending Program Changes from 0-26
- Currently sending on Midi Channel 1

FUTURE UPDATES 
- Midi Clock Send with Tap Tempo and BPM read out <- will need some help with this as this is beyond me
- Relay Bypass Switching 
- Real Time Patch Editing -> at the moment if you need to change the banks and sends you need to plug the arduino into a PC and make changes VIA arduino IDE. Real time patch editing would be MASSIVE as it would mean that people with no programming experience can just upload the code and get going.
